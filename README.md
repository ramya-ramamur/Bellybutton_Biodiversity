Build a dynamic dashboard to analyze human navel bacteria using JavaScript, Plotly, D3, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

# Bellybutton_Biodiversity

# Purpose
The project builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. It will identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons to help in research of manufacturing sythetic beef. 

The interactive dashboard will review the data with:

* Table displaying each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
* Horizontal bar chart with the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Gauge Chart with the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

# Resources
* Data Source: ["Belly button samples data"](https://github.com/ramya-ramamur/Bellybutton_Biodiversity/blob/main/static/samples.json)
* Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, BootStrap 3.3.7, D3, Plotly 4.11
